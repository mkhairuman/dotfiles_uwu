# dotfiles uwu owo xd rawr

![LVDS1 is enough until you encounter HDMI1](/assets/images/nordt.png)

## What
As the name suggests, dotfiles_uwu is well, dotfiles. Specifically, the config files that I use to create my desktop.
The current setup is a 1920x1080 screen connected to a 1366x768

## Who
Obviously, I didn't write these from scratch (except from plbr/simplex, which I copied from some other configs). So, credits to everyone else who wrote those.

## Why
A colleague said to me that I better put my codes onto git, so I did.
Also I want to post to r/unixporn someday, which requires me to write dotfiles so others can take inspirations (read: copy) from my desktop.

## How
Quick and easy way to create a kino desktop (cheap men's edition 2023):
1. Go [here](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn).
2. Browse for whatever you want to find.
3. Click on the post/thread.
4. Check their dotfiles.
5. "Take inspirations from" (again, read: copy) their dotfiles.
6. ???
7. Profit!

## FAQ that goes in my mind
> It looks just like any other desktops!

Yes. Yes it is. My brain is not big enough to design a desktop from scratch, yet.

> What if you someday want to changes?

I might create a branch, or just push it altogether. The former would probably be better, since I can switch back and forth without typing
But I like typing. I like to hear the clacks of my keyboard.

> Any other screenshots?

~~Yes, maybe, not now.~~

Updated the main screenshot (and the whole repo) to Nord ~~since I don't really like gruvbox kek~~
